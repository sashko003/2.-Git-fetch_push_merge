Taras Hryhorovych Shevchenko (March 9 [O.S. February 25] 1814 – March 10 [O.S. February 26] 1861) 
was a Ukrainian poet, writer, artist, public and political figure, as well as 
folklorist and ethnographer. His literary heritage is regarded to be the 
foundation of modern Ukrainian literature and, to a large extent, the modern 
Ukrainian language. Shevchenko is also known for many masterpieces as a painter 
and an illustrator.

He was a member of the Sts Cyril and Methodius Brotherhood and an academician 
of the Imperial Academy of Arts. In 1847 Shevchenko was politically convicted 
for writing in the Ukrainian language, promoting the independence of Ukraine 
and ridiculing the members of the Russian Imperial House.

CHILDHOOD

Taras Shevchenko was born on March 9 [O.S. February 25] 1814 in the village of Moryntsi, 
Zvenyhorodka county, Kiev Governorate, Russian Empire (today Zvenyhorodka Raion, 
Ukraine). He was the third child after his sister Kateryna and brother Mykyta,
in family of serf peasants Hryhoriy Ivanovych Shevchenko (1782? – 1825) and 
Kateryna Yakymivna Shevchenko (Boiko) (1782? – August 6, 1823), both of whom were 
owned by landlord Vasily Engelhardt. According to the family legends, Taras's 
forefathers were Cossacks who served in the Zaporizhian Host and had taken part 
in the Ukrainian uprisings of the 17th and 18th centuries. Those uprisings were 
brutally suppressed in Cherkasy, Poltava, Kiev, Bratslav, and Chernihiv 
disrupting normal social life for many years afterwards. Most of the local 
population were then enslaved and reduced to poverty.

In 1816 Shevchenko family moved back to the village of Kyrylivka (today Shevchenkove) 
in Zvenyhorodka county, where Taras' father, Hryhoriy Ivanovych, had been born. 
Taras spent his childhood years in the village. On May 24 [O.S. May 12] 1816, 
Taras' sister Yaryna was born, and on February 7 [O.S. January 26] 1819 - 
Maria. Once, young Taras went looking for "the iron pillars that hold up the sky" 
and got lost. Chumaks who met the boy took him with him to Kerelivka. On March 20 
[O.S. March 8] 1821 Taras' brother Yosyp was born.

In the fall of 1822 Taras started to take some grammar classes at a local precentor 
(dyak) Sovhyr. At that time Shevchenko became familiar with Hryhoriy Skovoroda's 
works. During 1822-1828 Shevchenko painted horses and soldiers.
